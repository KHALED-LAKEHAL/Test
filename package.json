  "description": "Timeline views display appointments as a sequence of events on a horizontal timeline, as opposed to basic views that display appointments in a calendar format. You can use the View Switcher above the timetable to switch between the views.\nList timeline views in the views array to add them to your Scheduler. To activate a specific view at application startup, use the currentView property.\nFor information about all supported view types, refer to the following help topic: View Types.\nThis demo shows multiple calendars side-by-side (with data grouped by resources). For information on how to configure such a display, see the following demos:\n\nResources\nGroup Orientation\n\n",
